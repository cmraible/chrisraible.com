# Improvements
After reading up a bit on the Artblocks website, I realized that the hash strings I was using as seeds were really in hexadecimal format, which means that each character can represent a number from 0-15.
Previously I was simply stripping any characters that weren't numbers from the seed string, which made for a shorter string with less randomness.

This time I used the `parseInt(x, 16)` function to decode the hexadecimal characters to a value from 0-15.

# Experiment
Whereas my first experiment was a series of blurry circles, I decided the logical next step was to play around with some rectangles, so that's what I did.

I adjusted the parameters quite a bit from my first experiment, and ended up with something reminiscent of a Windows screensaver from the 90s, which gave me a whole new appreciation for screensavers.
