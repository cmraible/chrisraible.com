# Inspiration
I've been lurking in the crypto community for quite a while, and I've recently begun diving into the world of NFTs. Unfortunately I'm too poor to invest a couple hundred/thousand dollars into a JPEG, so I was looking for another way to participate.

I'm particularly interested in the concept of generative art — art that is generated by code — and decided to try my hand at a basic generative art project.

I had some experience with [D3.js](https://d3js.org) and [SVGs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG), so I figured I could start there.

There's a project live on Artblocks, a generative art / NFT platform, right now called [Chroma Theory](https://www.artblocks.io/project/170) that caught my eye in particular, so I decided to model my efforts after that project.

# Result
Here's my result below. You can click to regenerate endlessly and each time it will generate a completely unique piece of abstract art, ultimately generated based on the exact timestamp you click it. 

<ReactChroma />

# Code

And here's the code:

<ReactChromaCode />


export default ({ children, meta }) => <Post meta={meta}>{children}</Post>;
