# Motivation
My goal for this project was to create a personal website with a blog, that would cost $0 to host and publish content. 
There are plenty of easy ways to make a personal site, but since this is just a hobby for me, I wanted it to be totally, completely free.

Additionally, since a lot of my planned content will be about writing code and showing off some personal projects, I wanted the flexibility to use custom code on my website, without incurring a huge amount of maintenance or infrastructure to manage.

# Approach
So, how do you make a website without spending any money? You make it as simple as possible:
- No traditional database, because those cost money

There are a number of web hosts that offer simple, file-based web hosting for free, so I decided I had to build a simple, file-based personal site, without any of the extravagance that a CMS offers.

Having decided on a file-based website, there were a number of options to consider:
- A simple, old-school HTML & CSS based website — just write the HTML and CSS, and host the files on a 

# Enter NextJS and Vercel
I promise I'm not getting paid to say this, but from working with NextJS and Vercel together before, it is a truly awesome development experience.

NextJS is a ReactJS based frontend framework with batteries included that takes care of a lot of really annoying-to-implement things like server side rendering (SSR) and file-based routing. Vercel is a webhost — with a free plan — that integrates beautifully with NextJS to make deployments super simple and streamlined.

Getting a site up and running with this pair makes life super easy for developers, because you really don't need to setup _any_ infrastructure. 

# Getting Started with NextJS

NextJS is quick and easy to get started using — so quick and easy in fact that I won’t go into detail here. The excellent NextJS documentation will walk you through installing NodeJS if you don’t already have it installed, and through creating your first NextJS app. Click the following link to get started:

# Adding a blog to a NextJS site with MDX

Now this is where the magic really begins. As I mentioned earlier, trying to use a CMS like Ghost or Wordpress would incur a monthly charge, so that option is out the window. One alternative would be to just create a new page in our NextJS app for each blog post, but this has one major disadvantage: you then have to wrap each element in a tag.
