Here are 5 things you didn’t know you could do with Python:

## 1. Buy stocks and cryptocurrencies with Alpaca’s broker APIs

[Alpaca](https://alpaca.markets/) is essentially a stock broker, but unlike most brokers, they allow you to make buy/sell orders using APIs instead of through a web interface like most brokers. This means you can write Python code that will call Alpaca’s APIs, and buy and sell stock on your behalf.

## 2. Send a text message using Twilio

[Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/) has a really neat API that allows you to send text messages to a given phone number. Using a few lines of Python code, you can send yourself or a friend a text message. This can be handy for building 2 factor authentication flows, sending text notifications or reminders.

## 3. Send Ethereum over the blockchain

Most Ethereum wallets have the functionality to send Ethereum to any valid Ethereum address. You can also do this with Python using [Web3.py](https://web3py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) — a neat open-source package that makes it easier to interact with web3.

## 4. Download your bank account transactions using Plaid

Another cool API you can use with Python is [Plaid](https://plaid.com/), which offers integrations with your bank accounts, so you can retrieve things like transactions and account balances from all your different bank accounts. You’ve probably used Plaid as a customer before, if you’ve used any personal finance apps, but you can also use Plaid as a developer, to either create an application to share with others or just to help manage your own finances.

## 5. Manage AWS infrastructure

[AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) publishes a [Python SDK](https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-python/) that allows you to manage — view, create and delete — most types of standard AWS infrastructure like EC2 instances and RDS databases. AWS is extremely powerful and opens up a whole work of computing at your fingertips — now you can orchestrate complex infrastructure using Python code to automate complex routines.
