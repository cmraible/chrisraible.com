## What is a trading bot?

The basic premise of most trading bots is that you create a computer program that subscribes to market data — typically price and trading volume over time — and interprets that data to generate buy and sell signals. The bot will then send an API call to a broker, who will execute the trade on the bot’s behalf.

## Trading Strategies

For this project, we will use a simple trading strategy, which is the logic determining how you generate buy and sell signals. This is where the magic really happens. Creating and deploying a simple bot as I’ll demonstrate here is relatively easy — identifying a trading strategy that is profitable with minimal risk is a much more daunting challenge. Having a bot alone does not give you much of an advantage in the market, unless you have a solid trading strategy to go along with it. 

## Caution

For this tutorial, we will only use a paper trading account, meaning we’ll be trading with fake money with our broker. I strongly recommend you thoroughly backtest any strategy using historic data before deploying it to a live account with real money. Backtesting is basically testing how your trading strategy *would have performed* if you had used it in the past. This post won’t go into detail on backtesting, but you should definitely learn more about it before deploying any strategy with real money.

The strategy introduced in this example is totally arbitrary and I don’t make any claims to it’s profitability — in fact, I bet it’s not very profitable at all compared to a reasonable benchmark. Also, this is not battle-tested, production ready code. This is a very simple proof of concept to get you started on algorithmic trading. There are many features I would add — detecting market open/close, text alerts for every trade, monitoring tools, etc — before deploying this with real money. **Please don’t just copy/paste this code and start trading with your actual money — that would be really, really stupid.**

## Technical Overview

We’re going to write a Python script that calls Alpaca APIs. Alpaca is our broker. Just like any other broker, they allow us to buy and sell stocks, but unlike most brokers we can send them orders via an API call. They also recently introduced crypto trading, meaning you can trade Bitcoin and Ethereum algorithmically with this code, with some minor modifications.

The script will:

- Listen to a continuous stream of market data, also provided by Alpaca
- Calculate some technical indicators based on the market data
- Use those technical indicators to generate buy and sell signals
- Execute trades automatically via an API call to our broker

In this post we will just write the script and get it working, running it locally on our own machine. In a future post, I’ll go into how you could deploy this bot to AWS so you don’t have to tie your personal computer up running this script 24/7.

## Knowledge Assumptions

For this post, I’m assuming you have at least basic knowledge in:

- Python
- Git
- UNIX Command Line

## Writing and running the Python Script locally

The full code below can be found on [Github](https://github.com/cmraible/tradingbot).

### Setting up git repository and installing Packages

First, we need to setup a fresh working directory and git repository. Starting from a location you’ll remember in your command line — I prefer to keep a “Developer” folder for all my coding projects in my home directory — make a new git repository locally and call it tradingbot using:

```bash
git init tradingbot
```

Then cd into your new tradingbot directory:

```bash
cd tradingbot
```

Next, we need to install two packages. I like to use pipenv for package management, which creates and manages our virtual environment, similar to npm in JavaScript. If you don’t already have pipenv installed, you can use the instructions provided [here](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/install/). 

The packages we need to install are:

- [alpaca-trade-api](https://github.com/alpacahq/alpaca-trade-api-python)
    - A utility for working with the Alpaca API, which handles things like authentication a bit more cleanly than using the requests library.
- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
    - A comprehensive data analysis library for Python, which we will use to calculate our technical indicators.

To install these, run the following command:

```bash
pipenv install alpaca-trade-api pandas
```

This will create a virtual environment and install the two packages listed. It will also create a Pipfile and a Pipefile.lock

### Connecting to the websocket to get market data streamed live

We want to connect to the Alpaca market data APIs to subscribe to minute-bar data via a websocket. Every minute, we’ll receive the open, high, low and close of the symbol over the previous minute. We’ll then query some historical data, calculate some technical indicators and determine if we want to buy or sell the stock.

Let’s start with a simple Python class.

First, we’ll instantiate our class with some basic variables — particularly which symbol we’re trading and our API keys. Then we’ll have a run() method, which will connect to the websocket and maintain a persistent connection — hopefully eternally. Before deploying with real money, it would be good to have some retry mechanism here if the connection fails for some reason.

The run() method will in turn call another method every minute, or every *bar —* we’ll call this the bar_callback() method. This is where we will calculate our technical indicators and determine whether to buy or sell.

Open up your text editor to your tradingbot folder and create a new file for the class and call it TradingBot.py. This is where we’ll create our class:


```python filename=TradingBot.py

from alpaca_trade_api import REST

class TradingBot():
    '''An algorithmic trading bot.'''

    def __init__(self, symbol, api_key, secret_key):
        '''Initiate some important variables and load initial data.'''
        # Set instance variables
        self.symbol = symbol
        self.api_key = api_key
        self.secret_key = secret_key
        self.base_url = 'https://paper-api.alpaca.markets' # change this to live url when ready
        self.stream_url = 'wss://stream.data.alpaca.markets/v2/sip'
        # Create api client object that can be accessed from any method
        self.api = REST(key_id=self.api_key, secret_key=self.secret_key, base_url=self.base_url)

    def get_position(self):
        '''Utility to retrieve our current position, or None from the API.''' 
        pass

    async def bar_callback(self, t):
        '''Run on every bar sent via websocket. This contains the meat of the strategy.'''
        pass

    def run(self):
        '''Connect to websocket and continuously monitor for messages.'''
        pass
```

 Now that we’ve outlined our basic class, let’s start with the run() function and setup the connection to the websocket. Using our Alpaca API keys, we’ll instantiate an instance of our API utility helper in the class’ __**init**__() method. Then in our run() method, we create a stream object and subscribe to the symbol we selected using the subscribe_bars() method of our API helper. Finally, we initiate the connection using stream.run().

```python
from alpaca_trade_api.stream import Stream

class TradingBot():
    '''An algorithmic trading bot.'''

    ## ..........

    def run(self):
        '''Connect to websocket and continuously monitor for messages.'''
        # Create a stream object using api keys and base url
        stream = Stream(self.api_key, self.secret_key, base_url=self.stream_url)
        # Subscribe to minute bars for the symbol passed to this class
        # On every bar, call the self.bar_callback method with the previous bar's data
        stream.subscribe_bars(self.bar_callback, self.symbol)

        logging.info('Opening connection...')
        stream.run()
        logging.info('Connection closed.')
```

Great! So now we’re connecting to the websocket, and on every piece of data returned, we are calling our bar_callback() method…and doing nothing! Let’s start by simply logging the data that we receive on every bar, to test out that the websocket connection is working as expected.

```python
from alpaca_trade_api.stream import Stream
import logging

class TradingBot():
    '''An algorithmic trading bot.'''

    ## ..........

    async def bar_callback(self, t):
        '''Run on every bar sent via websocket. This contains the meat of the strategy.'''
        timestamp = datetime.datetime.utcfromtimestamp(t.timestamp/1000000000)
        logging.info('Bar received at %s.' % (timestamp))
        logging.info(t)

    ## ..........

```

Now that we’re connected to the websocket and logging the data returned, let’s actually run our script for the first time to test everything out. Create a new file and call it main.py. In this file, we’ll do a few things:

- Setup a some logging handlers
- Grab our API keys from our environment variables — if you’re using pipenv, you can simply store these in a .env file in the project’s home directory. *Be sure to add .env to your .gitignore so you don’t commit any secrets to your git repository.*
- Create an instance of our TradingBot, passing the symbol we want to trade and our API keys
- Call the run() method on our TradingBot, which will connect to the websocket and then print the data returned every minute (assuming the market is open)

```python
import logging
import os
from TradingBot import TradingBot

logging.basicConfig(handlers=[
        # logging.FileHandler("debug.log"),
        logging.StreamHandler()
    ], format='%(asctime)s %(message)s', level=logging.INFO)

alpaca_api_key = os.environ.get('APAC_API_KEY_ID')
alpaca_api_secret_key = os.environ.get('APAC_API_SECRET_KEY')

bot = TradingBot(symbol='AAPL', api_key=alpaca_api_key, secret_key=alpaca_api_secret_key)
bot.run()
```

Then you can run your code from the command line using the following command:

```bash
pipenv run python -m main.py
```

### Writing our strategy

Now that we have the pipes connected, let’s get to the actual logic. First we query the data from Alpaca. We could also record the data locally as it comes in over the websocket, which would have some advantages in terms of speed, but for our purposes we’ll just fire off an API call to Alpaca to get our historical data. With the data in hand, we’ll calculate some technical indicators using [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/). We want to calculate a 20 and 50 period simple moving average.

```python
async def bar_callback(self, t):
    '''Run on every bar sent via websocket. This contains the meat of the strategy.'''
    timestamp = datetime.datetime.utcfromtimestamp(t.timestamp/1000000000)
    logging.info('Bar received at %s.' % (timestamp))
    logging.info(t)

    # Call the API to determine if we have a position currently or not
    self.position = self.get_position()
    # Call the API to get other account details, like cash on-hand, etc.
    self.account = self.api.get_account()
    # Call the API to get recent bars from the server
		# Store data in a pandas dataframe to make calculating indicators easier
    # We could also store recent data in memory which would be faster
    logging.info('Retrieving recent bars for %s.' % (self.symbol))
    bars = self.api.get_bars(self.symbol, TimeFrame.Minute).df
    logging.info('Recent bars received.')

    # Calculate indicators using pandas pd.Series.rolling() method
    bars['sma20'] = bars['close'].rolling(20).mean()
    bars['sma50'] = bars['close'].rolling(50).mean()
```

We’re going to buy the stock if the 20 minute simple moving average (sma20) moves above the 50 minute simple moving average (sma50). ****In other words, we want to buy the stock when the previous sma20 was below the previous sma50 **and** the current sma20 is above the current sma50. If those two conditions are true, it means the sma20 *just* crossed the sma50 while moving in an upward direction, hopefully indicating an uptrend in the stock price.

To do this, first we’ll set some convenience variables for accessing the current and previous simple moving averages. We’ll use pandas .iloc[] method to grab the most recent two bars received, and specifically grab the values of the sma20 and sma50. 

Append this to the end of your bar_callback() method:

```python
# Set some convenience variables
close = t.close
sma20 = bars['sma20'].iloc[-1]
sma50 = bars['sma50'].iloc[-1]
prev_sma20 = bars['sma20'].iloc[-2]
prev_sma50 = bars['sma50'].iloc[-2]
```

Then we’ll add some logic to determine if our buying conditions have been met:

```python
# If we're not currently in a position...we might sell
if not self.position:
    # If the sma20 crosses above the sma50, buy buy buy!
    if sma20 > sma50 and prev_sma20 < prev_sma50:
        # Calculate how many shares to buy
        # A little less than 100% because the API doesn't seem to accept 100%
        cash = float(self.account.cash)
        allin = math.floor((cash/close)*10000*.95) / 10000
        try:
            logging.info('BUY %.2f %s @ $%.2f' % (allin, self.symbol, close))
            order = self.api.submit_order(self.symbol, qty=allin, side="buy", type="market")
        except Exception as e:
            logging.info('Unable to complete order: %s' % (e))
```

Buying stocks is great, but you don’t really make any money until you sell it, so next we’ll add the logic to determine when to sell the stock. In this case, we will sell the stock when the two moving averages cross again and hope that we made a profit:

```python
else:
    # We are currently in a long position
    logging.info(self.position)
    # In case we have multiple strategies running on different symbols
    if self.position.symbol == self.symbol:
				# Since the sma20 already crossed above the sma50, we know the sma20 is already above the sma50
        if (sma20 < sma50):
            try:
                logging.info('SELL %s @ $%.2f' % (self.symbol, close))
                order = self.api.submit_order(self.symbol, qty=self.position.qty, side="sell", type="market")
            except Exception as e:
                logging.info('Unable to complete order: %s' % e)
```

### Version Control

Now that we have our script written, let’s commit it to our git repository. 

```bash
git add .
git commit -m 'initial commit'
```

I highly recommend you get into the habit of committing every change to your strategy to version control before testing it with a reasonably detailed commit message describing the strategy — this way you can always roll back to a previous, more successful strategy very easily. You can also use git to maintain different branches of strategies, based on the general category.

### Running our Script Locally

Just as you did before when we were testing the connection to the websocket, you can use the following command to run your script:

```python
pipenv run python -m main.py
```

It will open up a persistent connection to the websocket that should last indefinitely, regardless of whether the market is open or closed. It will run in your terminal until you shutdown the process, either by hitting ctrl + C in your terminal, or closing the terminal window altogether. This is great for testing — it’s important you are super confident your algorithm is doing what you *think* it’s doing, so lots of testing is important. 

However, running your bot locally has some disadvantages — mainly that you have to keep your computer open and awake. Personally I only have a laptop, so I would have to keep my laptop turned on and plugged in all day — not ideal, especially if we are making lots of money with this algorithm. Any downtime could potentially be very costly, so it would be better to have a more robust solution.

## Next Steps

In a future post, I’ll go into detail on how to deploy our trading bot to AWS using Kubernetes and Docker, along with how to setup a CI/CD pipeline using CircleCI.
