# Motivation
My goal for this project was to create a personal website with a blog, that would cost $0 to host and publish content. There are plenty of easy ways to make a personal site, but as this is really just a hobby for me, I wanted it to be totally, completely free. Additionally, since a lot of my planned content will be about writing code and showing off some personal projects, I wanted the flexibility to use completely custom code on my website.

# Approach
So, how do you make a website without spending any money? You make it as simple as possible:
- No dynamic content served from a database, because databases cost money
- No traditional CMS like Wordpress or Ghost, because those are just databases with an extra layer on top, which means they cost money

The only real option is to create a fully static website and host it on a free web host, of which there are a few these days.

So I’ve decided on a static website, but there are hundreds of ways to make a static website:

The simplest way is to write the website in plain HTML and CSS, like [Paul Graham](http://paulgraham.com/) probably does. This is a totally valid option and it certainly has some benefits (speed, simplicity, maintenance), but I don’t like this option mainly because you have to write HTML tags around all your content — and that doesn’t make for a great writing/editing environment.

A slightly more complex option is to use a more modern static site generator, and this is ultimately what I chose to do. Static site generators ultimately compile to plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript files and are subsequently served the same way as an old-school HTML website. This additional complexity is a small price to pay for the additional functionality you can enable with such a setup. I ultimately chose to go with NextJS, because it seems to be the most popular option, I was already familiar with it, and it integrates beautifully with Vercel, my free-web-host-of-choice.

# NextJS and Vercel
I promise I'm not getting paid to say this, but from working with NextJS and Vercel together before, it is a truly awesome developer experience.

[NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) is an open source, ReactJS based frontend framework with batteries included that takes care of a lot of really annoying-to-implement things like server side rendering and file-based routing. [Vercel](https://vercel.com) is a web host that integrates beautifully with NextJS because they actually built NextJS to begin with! Since Vercel is the company that builds and manages NextJS, the two work hand-in-hand to create a truly excellent developer experience.

Best of all, Vercel has a [generous free plan](https://vercel.com/pricing) for hobby projects that allows you to host a static website completely for free, so long as it’s not for commercial use. 

# Enter MDX
You may be thinking that building a website in JavaScript instead of HTML doesn’t really solve the problem of having to write out HTML tags, and you’d be right. The additional complexity of building a JavaScript frontend that compiles to HTML only makes writing content easier with some additional magic at the compile phase: [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/).

MDX is some magic that allows you to write content in markdown and have that compiled to HTML during the build phase. This simplifies your writing workflow by allowing you to write in simplified Markdown instead of tag-based HTML. MDX also has some additional magic built in that allows you to mix in React Components with your Markdown code — so you can do things like add custom data visualizations to your blog posts, which is exactly the type of functionality that I’m after.

# Putting it all together
My blog is built using NextJS with a sprinkle of MDX for blog posts. It’s hosted on Vercel with their generous free hosting plan. This combination of technologies/services allows me to host my personal site and blog completely for free, excluding the cost of my custom domain name which only costs $12 / year. 

My workflow is relatively simple: I write the code for the NextJS blog in the same git repo that I write blog posts. Whenever I push a branch to my main branch, any changes I've made to the website template or any new blog posts I've written are deployed automatically with Vercel.

# What's next
In Part 1 and Part 2, I'll go through the process of building the site & blog in detail, assuming only that you're familiar with JavaScript and React development. I'll introduce and get you started on NextJS, guide you through integrating MDX into your NextJS project, deploying your project to production with Vercel and adding a custom domain.
